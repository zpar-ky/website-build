      <description>Table of Contents Introduction Before the OS: Setting up RAID Installing the OS (CentOS 7) The Base Packages Security Monitoring with Grafana Docker Setup 0 . Introduction The goal of this post will be to go from a blank server to a server running Docker for software containerization, as well other software for more advanced usage like VMs.
For some background, I&amp;rsquo;d like to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the homelab community for quite some time.</description>

      <description>When I started archiving twitch streams, my data usage went up dramatically. As I had to both download and upload each stream, I was easily pushing 60 gigabytes a day. And that was just streaming. But that&amp;rsquo;s actually going to be another post, as my setup has gotten significantly more complex now that I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to a VPS.
Anyway, I was essentially using almost two terabytes of data a month, split among stream archiving, general usage, and media ingesting.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, simply downloading Twitch VODs aren&amp;rsquo;t good enough. The major one for me is that VODs will have copyrighted content muted, so if the stream has a copyrighted song playing, an entire 5+ minute chunk of the video will be muted. You can get around this by streaming the stream to a local file with streamlink.
Pretty simple, until you want it to not be. Let&amp;rsquo;s make it difficult, with powershell scripting, timed scripts, and error handling!</description>
