      <description>When I started archiving twitch streams, my data usage went up dramatically. As I had to both download and upload each stream, I was easily pushing 60 gigabytes a day. And that was just streaming. But that&amp;rsquo;s actually going to be another post, as my setup has gotten significantly more complex now that I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to a VPS.
Anyway, I was essentially using almost two terabytes of data a month, split among stream archiving, general usage, and media ingesting.</description>
