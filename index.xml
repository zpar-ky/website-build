      <title>How to Automatically Archive Twitch Streams - The Hard Way</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, simply downloading Twitch VODs aren&amp;rsquo;t good enough. The major one for me is that VODs will have copyrighted content muted, so if the stream has a copyrighted song playing, an entire 5+ minute chunk of the video will be muted. You can get around this by streaming the stream to a local file with streamlink.
Pretty simple, until you want it to not be. Let&amp;rsquo;s make it difficult, with powershell scripting, timed scripts, and error handling!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m constantly tinkering with stuff, either through code or physical projects, and often both at the same time.
Here is a list of all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to that I&amp;rsquo;m proud of
 Keyboards and Keyboard Firmware 
QMK Firmware Contributor  I helped port the QMK custom firmware to the YMD96, a keyboard I bought. Others have since built on what I started and made the keyboard firmware even better.</description>
